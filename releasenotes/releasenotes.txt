        Recording:

        Reduce cataloging time to 10 mins - previously took hours
        Remove the catchup server host and port from podcast URLs from the catalog
        Add a catalog start hour so cataloging always starts at a set hour of day and occurs every X hours
        Only start cataloging on startup if the catalog looks sparse otherwise wait to scheduled time
        Deal with duplicate programme entries in iplayer

        General:

        Moved the catchup server to its own JVM to limit the plugins impact on SageTV classpath
        Set up RMI servers in plugin and the now separate server for better control and feedback
        Add seed properties for 32bit windows e.g. windows XP
        Increased maximum heap size to 500Mb
