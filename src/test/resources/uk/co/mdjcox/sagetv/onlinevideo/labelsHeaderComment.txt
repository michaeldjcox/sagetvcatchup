# This properties file contains custom user definitions for the text displayed
# in the SageTV UI for custom user-added online video menu items.
#
# To add custom online video links, see the comments near the top of the
# "CustomOnlineVideoLinks.properties" file.
#
# After adding a new feed in "CustomOnlineVideoLinks.properties", select that
# (blank) item in SageTV to download its list of content and automatically set
# its initial icon and title. Aterwards, the icon and/or title can be edited
# near the end of this file.
#
# NOTE: If the same property names are used in this file as are in the default
# properties file (OnlineVideoUIText.properties), the default values will be
# overwritten inside SageTV!
#
#
# To create a language translation file, use the 2-letter language code added to
# the base filename after an underscore. Example: For a German language version
# of this file, copy the default filename:

# to the _de version: 
#       CustomOnlineVideoUIText_de.properties
# 
# Then, change the property values.
