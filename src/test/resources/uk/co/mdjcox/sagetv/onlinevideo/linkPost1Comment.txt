#
# Subcategory definitions
#
#	To create a subcategory, use the following three lines as examples:
#
#       xFeedPodcastCustom/NameOfSubCat=xPodcastCustom;xURLNone
#       NameOfSubCat/IsCategory=true
#       NameOfSubCat/CategoryName=xPodcastNameOfSubCat
#
#   In this example, "NameOfSubCat" is the FeedName of the subcategory, which
#   is used to sort the subcategory into its parent category - "xPodcastCustom"
#   in this example.
#
#	"xPodcastNameOfSubCat" is now the text used to assign feeds to this
#	subcategory.
#
#	Be sure to define the subcategory names as shown in the examples in 
#	"CustomOnlineVideoUIText.properties", both the "Category" and "Source"
#   names, as follows:
#
#       Category/NameOfSubCat/LongName=<Full Name to display in feed list>
#       Category/NameOfSubCat/ShortName=<Short Name of subcategory>
#       Source/xPodcastNameOfSubCat/LongName=<Full Name to display as menu title>
#       Source/xPodcastNameOfSubCat/ShortName=<Short Name to display in menu title>
#
# ============================================================
#
# Externally generated feeds
#
# An external application can be used to generate an XML file for a feed rather
# than downloading the feed. To use a custom external application, format the
# FeedURL portion of the feed property as follows:
#
# 	external,filename.exe,param1||param2||param3||...paramN
